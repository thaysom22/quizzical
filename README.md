### Design Choices

The overall tone of the site is a balance of fun and friendly with educational credibility. The design aims to appeal to both school age students using the site content directly, as well to other adult users accessing and sharing content.
Inspiration for design and layout was taken from a number of (much more sophisticated) online quiz sites (see [credits](#credits)). 
The colors, styling, and icons were chosen to present a familiar and intuitive user interface whilst maintaining sufficient contrast between elements and areas of the page, as well as a consistent overall layout and feel across the site.

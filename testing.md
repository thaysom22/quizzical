## 1. Automated Testing
----------

### Validation Services

* [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) used to validate HTML

### Unit Testing

* The amount and complexity of Javascript used in this project was not enought to warrant implementing unit tests with Jasmine - manual testing done on Javascript functionality. 
* I would liked to have implemented unit testing for the Python functions in the codebase, however given the deadline of the project and my limited time available I decided this was not a priority for this project. I aim to familiarize and improve my skills with unit testing in Python in a future project.

## 2. User Stories Testing
----------

## 3. Manual Testing
----------

## 4. Bugs Discovered
----------

### Fixed

* Error: HTML validator showing error: "button element must not appear as descendant of a element. Fix: changed `<button>` elements which are child of `<a>` elements into `<span>` elements.

### Not fixed


## 5. Further Testing
